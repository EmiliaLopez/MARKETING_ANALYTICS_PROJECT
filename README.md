### MARKETING ANALYTICS PROJECT

**`¬°Welcome back! üëãüèº`**
 
IFood is the lead food delivery app in Brazil, the company holds over 80% market share of the food delivery sector in Brazil. iFood broke sales records during the FIFA World Cup in Qatar, where more than 8 million orders were placed on the app over the weekend of December 2-4, the best mark in 2022. Keeping a high customer engagement is key for growing an consolidating the company's position as the market leader.    

The dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jackdaoud/marketing-data?datasetId=1046184&sortBy=voteCount&select=dictionary.png).

## Business Case:

The dataset contains information regarding a pilot campaing involving **2.240 customers**, customers who bought the offer were properly labeled. The total cost of the sample campaign was **6.720$** and the revenue generated by customers was **3.674$**.
Globally the campaing had a profit of -3.046$ and the success of the campaign was **15%**.

The Chief Marketing Officer notifies me as markeyting analyst that recent marketing campaings have not been as effective as they were expected to be. The company wants to produce the highest profit for the next marketing campaign, scheduled for next month. 


## Objectives

**Analyze the customer profile understanding the dataset and propose data-driven solutions**. Proposal of customer segmentation based on customers behaviours.

**Prediction of the amount that will be spent per customer** in terms of the provided customer characteristics. 

This analysis will provide marketers with valuable insights to shape strategic decisions regarding advertising and efectively target a chosen group of potential customers, utilizing predictions of their future spending patterns.


## Challenges
**Perform an end-to-end analysis** applying statistical or machine learning techniques and present the results.   

**Ensuring data quality and predictive modelling**: it is very important to ensuring the accuracy, completeness, and reliability of the customer data used for analysis as well as developing accurate and reliable models to predict customer expenditure based on available customer characteristics.   


## Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, correcting data types, renaming columns, handling inconsistencies in data..
2. **Data Wrangling**: Filtering rows based on conditions, sorting data, reshaping data, grouping data based on categories..

5. **Power BI dashboard**: Create a dashboard on Power BI to expose the relevant insights of the anlysis and exposing the results of previous questions.
